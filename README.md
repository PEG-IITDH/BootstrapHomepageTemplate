# BootstrapHomepageTemplate

A simple Bootstrap theme template for an academic webpage, themed with IIT
Dharwad colours and typography.

Bootstrap is a simple Javascript Library that enables lightweight yet responsive pages that look and feel great on all devices, from small mobile phones to tablets to large desktop displays.

To edit, I recomment the open-source  editor "Brackets" which has a "live-preview" mode, showing the changes as the HTML code is modified.
